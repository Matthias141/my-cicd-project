# 🚀 Enterprise-Grade CI/CD Pipeline with AWS Lambda

A production-grade CI/CD pipeline demonstrating modern DevOps practices, advanced deployment strategies, and comprehensive security features with serverless architecture.

## 🎯 Overview

This project showcases:
- **Serverless Architecture**: AWS Lambda + API Gateway with auto-scaling
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform for all AWS resources
- **Advanced Deployments**: Blue-green deployments with canary releases
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions with multi-environment deployment
- **Load Testing**: Locust-based performance testing with automated analysis
- **Security**: WAF, API authentication, input validation, vulnerability scanning
- **Observability**: CloudWatch logs, metrics, alarms, dashboards, and X-Ray tracing
- **Cost Optimization**: 100% free tier usage with cold start mitigation

## 🏗️ Architecture
```
GitHub → GitHub Actions → ECR → Lambda → API Gateway → User
                    ↓
            [DEV] → [STAGING] → [PRODUCTION]
```

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

## 🚀 Deployment Environments

- **DEV**: Automatic deployment on every commit
- **STAGING**: Manual approval required
- **PRODUCTION**: Manual approval + comprehensive testing

## 📊 Features

### Core Infrastructure
- ✅ Automated testing with pytest
- ✅ Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
- ✅ Multi-environment deployment (dev/staging/prod)
- ✅ Lambda warm-up system (eliminates cold starts)
- ✅ Cost: $0/month (within AWS free tier)

### Advanced Deployment
- ✅ **Blue-green deployments** with canary releases (10% → 25% → 50% → 100%)
- ✅ **Automatic rollback** on error detection
- ✅ **Lambda aliases** for traffic shifting
- ✅ **Health checks** between deployment stages

### Security & Authentication
- ✅ **AWS WAF** with 6 security rules (rate limiting, SQL injection, XSS protection)
- ✅ **API Key authentication** with rate limiting
- ✅ **HMAC signature verification** for sensitive operations
- ✅ **Input validation** using Pydantic models
- ✅ **Security headers** (CSP, X-Frame-Options, XSS Protection, etc.)
- ✅ **Dependency scanning** (pip-audit, Safety)
- ✅ **Container scanning** (Trivy)
- ✅ **Code security analysis** (Bandit)

### Load Testing & Performance
- ✅ **Locust load testing** with multiple test scenarios
- ✅ **Automated performance benchmarks**
- ✅ **Performance threshold validation** (500ms avg, 1% error rate)
- ✅ **Load test reports** with recommendations

### Monitoring & Observability
- ✅ **8 CloudWatch alarms** (errors, throttles, latency, WAF blocks)
- ✅ **SNS notifications** for critical alerts
- ✅ **CloudWatch dashboard** with real-time metrics
- ✅ **X-Ray distributed tracing**
- ✅ **Comprehensive logging** with structured output

## 🔐 Security

- IAM roles with least privilege principle
- Secrets managed via AWS Secrets Manager
- Container vulnerability scanning with Trivy
- No hardcoded credentials
- GitHub Actions OIDC authentication

## 📈 Monitoring

- CloudWatch Logs for all Lambda executions
- CloudWatch Alarms for errors, throttling, and latency
- X-Ray distributed tracing
